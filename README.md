# Logic Path

# Agile workflow
With the use of  GitHub's kanban board, issues have been listed with labels for each, prioritising them in a manner that meets the project objective.
1. Adding essential features first
   - Backend functionalities have been added as a first iteration (install required libraries, create database with related tables, CRUD functionalities)
   - As a next step, templates and views that relate to CRUD have been done as a second iteration.
   - authentication with allauth take a place as a third step after testing the CRUD
2. GitHub Features / Issues
The user stories have been given a Github issue, each is prioritized and is a given one of three labels (Must have , Should have, Could have).
